In the time of Mozart, the composer of this piece, the piano as we know it today was not yet available, and the piece was played on harpsichord and fortepiano instruments. These instruments had several characteristics that differ from today's pianos.
One of the first is ""intensity. The instruments of the time were relatively low in volume, and were not good at producing fine changes in volume, such as crescendos and diminuendos, which were gradually increased or decreased in volume. Therefore, basically, a clear method of expression, such as ""strong"" or ""weak,"" was used.
In this piece, the main strength/weakness symbol is p (piano), which contrasts with sf (sforzando) that appears occasionally, and I think that is what makes this piece interesting.
I didn't hear much emphasis on that part in your performance, so I think you should try to emphasize this difference in strength and weakness.
First of all, let's try once how you would play it if this symbol was not there.
Don't just play it without the intensity, but try to play it with the beat in mind.
The six-eighths of the beat of this piece is a two-beat system, and the first and fourth beats (of eighth notes) are the strong beats. If you play it with that in mind, you will get a very natural and beautiful phrase.
Now let's play it with sf there. Then you will notice that the phrase sounds a little spicier than just a pretty phrase. This is Mozart's humor.



Another difference between the instruments of that time and today is the ""pedal.
Instruments back then did not have the ability to hold a note for a long time, or if they did, it was by pulling a lever with the hand, not by stepping on it with the foot like today's pedals. Therefore, excessive use of pedals should be avoided. It sounded like there was a little too much pedaling in your performance, so please pay attention to that.

Now, when playing Mozart, the most important thing to keep in mind is how to play the same notes in succession and how to play the notes at the end of a phrase.
In Mozart playing, you should always play these notes separately (apart).
For example, in the m-mi section in the second half of the first bar, there is a slight break before the m-mi that appears later. The end of the phrase in bars 4 and 12 should always be preceded by a small comma before the next bar, and bar 16 should appear to be the end of the phrase, but is actually the end of the phrase. In these cases, too, if you connect the notes at the end of the bar, it will sound too normal and the next forte will not be as effective. Experiment to find the most effective forte by experimenting with how far apart and how much of the phrase you can fit.

As for the forte at the end of the piece, there are many ways to interpret it. In your performance, both times you returned to the piano at the last bar, but it is also possible to play the forte all the way through. For example, you could play the first time and the second time after the repeat in different ways.
Also, in your performance, you played a ritardando at the end of the second time, but this also depends on the interpretation, but I think it would be fine to play it without making too big a rit, just to end it easily. Because if you look at the score, there is an eighth rest at the end. It makes sense to write the rests there. Compare this with the case where there is no rest and a dotted quarter note. If you play the rest as if it were to disappear, you will probably get the meaning of the rest.
Given that, if you do a leit in front of it, its effect may be lost.

There are many possible interpretations when creating detailed nuances like this, so please experiment with each of them and find the interpretation that you think is right.",test

I think that if you study the expression of the harmony, the expression will become even deeper and the melody will come alive.
For example, it would be good to listen carefully to the change of harmony when returning to the melody of a after the doppeldorfer dominant in the 8th bar, and play it with taste.
The overall excitement and sense of moving forward are expressed very well, so I think the performance will become more mature if the melody coming down from the 17th bar is given more color.
　I am concerned that the way the melody is sung after the climax is a little monotonous.
　Overall, I can tell that you have been practicing carefully.
　Please try to play it at the same length as the original.",test

In the time of Mozart, the composer of this piece, the piano as we know it today was not yet available, and the piece was played on harpsichord and fortepiano instruments. These instruments had several characteristics that differ from today's pianos.
One of the first is ""intensity. The instruments of the time were relatively low in volume, and were not good at producing fine changes in volume, such as crescendos and diminuendos, which were gradually increased or decreased in volume. Therefore, basically, a clear method of expression, such as ""strong"" or ""weak,"" was used.
In this piece, the main strength/weakness symbol is p (piano), which contrasts with sf (sforzando) that appears occasionally, and I think that is what makes this piece interesting.
I didn't hear much emphasis on that part in your performance, so I think you should try to emphasize this difference in strength and weakness.
First of all, let's try once how you would play it if this symbol was not there.
Don't just play it without the intensity, but try to play it with the beat in mind.
The six-eighths of the beat of this piece is a two-beat system, and the first and fourth beats (of eighth notes) are the strong beats. If you play it with that in mind, you will get a very natural and beautiful phrase.
Now let's play it with sf there. Then you will notice that the phrase sounds a little spicier than just a pretty phrase. This is Mozart's humor.



Another difference between the instruments of that time and today is the ""pedal.
Instruments back then did not have the ability to hold a note for a long time, or if they did, it was by pulling a lever with the hand, not by stepping on it with the foot like today's pedals. Therefore, excessive use of pedals should be avoided. It sounded like there was a little too much pedaling in your performance, so please pay attention to that.

Now, when playing Mozart, the most important thing to keep in mind is how to play the same notes in succession and how to play the notes at the end of a phrase.
In Mozart playing, you should always play these notes separately (apart).
For example, in the m-mi section in the second half of the first bar, there is a slight break before the m-mi that appears later. The end of the phrase in bars 4 and 12 should always be preceded by a small comma before the next bar, and bar 16 should appear to be the end of the phrase, but is actually the end of the phrase. In these cases, too, if you connect the notes at the end of the bar, it will sound too normal and the next forte will not be as effective. Experiment to find the most effective forte by experimenting with how far apart and how much of the phrase you can fit.

As for the forte at the end of the piece, there are many ways to interpret it. In your performance, both times you returned to the piano at the last bar, but it is also possible to play the forte all the way through. For example, you could play the first time and the second time after the repeat in different ways.
Also, in your performance, you played a ritardando at the end of the second time, but this also depends on the interpretation, but I think it would be fine to play it without making too big a rit, just to end it easily. Because if you look at the score, there is an eighth rest at the end. It makes sense to write the rests there. Compare this with the case where there is no rest and a dotted quarter note. If you play the rest as if it were to disappear, you will probably get the meaning of the rest.
Given that, if you do a leit in front of it, its effect may be lost.

There are many possible interpretations when creating detailed nuances like this, so please experiment with each of them and find the interpretation that you think is right.", Is there reasonalbe dynamics contrast? ," Need to emphasize the difference in strength and weakness, reflect the sf (sforzando) better.",test

Well, let me explain a little.
First of all, what does ""make it better"" mean? Let's clarify that.

This piece was written by the famous composer ""Beethoven. He is also called the saint of music.
He was the one who made the narrative of classical music clearer and paved the way for Romantic music.

First of all, a piece of music has the composer's ""feelings"". He wanted it to be played this way. I want you to play it like this, and I want you to play it like this, and I want you to play it like this.
I want the audience to be moved by the ""feelings"" that the composer has put into the music.
First of all, there is the composer's ""thought. It is written in the score.

For example, ""Alegro"" at the beginning of the piece is a word about the speed of the music, meaning ""lively and fast.
Rondo"" is the form of the piece and means to repeat the theme.
The same melody is repeated twice.

Another common word is ""cresc,"" which is an indication of strength or weakness.
It means to make it stronger in smooth, gradual steps.
Another common word is ""dolce,"" which means ""soften,
It means to soften the touch, to round out the tone, and to slightly reduce the volume.
In your playing, this
You could say that the ""cresc"" and ""dolce"" in your playing are not well processed, and as a result the intonation is flat.
It could be said that your performance has a flat intonation.

Now, another aspect of ""make it better"" is,
What is the message of this music?
A piece of music is a story. A story has a purpose.
To convey that purpose,

<Start> <Contextualization> <Event> <Completion> <Summarization> <Completion> <Decision

The story progresses in this order.
Now, let's see,
In this piece, the first 12 bars are a story - the theme.
Then, the next story is told immediately without a pause. This sense of speed without a pause creates a sense of tension in the piece.
creates a sense of tension in the piece. This is an important point.

From the 18th bar, the music starts a new story and continues until the 43rd bar.
The four quarter notes in measure 44 are ""p"" notes, so it would be better to play them more softly and lovingly.
The development of the story becomes clearer,
After the 51st bar, you can create a dynamic atmosphere by playing the notes with a sense of speed.

Since it is an Andantino, the speed is fine as it is, but I am concerned that the overall flow is a bit stagnant. You should be a little more aware of the flow of phrases so that you can dance a waltz to this piece at a ball.
Specifically, this piece is divided into the first half (~8 bars, beat 2) and the second half (~8 bars, beat 3), and if you are aware of the crescendo at the beginning of each part and the decrescendo towards the end, you will be able to capture the flow of the phrase.",train

Sorry, I just have two things to say about the way you play.

Overall, I was concerned about the impact of the second note followed by the same note.
If you don't press the next key until you feel the key return to your fingers (feel the hammer), I think you will get a natural series of hits. Please try it.

The other thing is the sf interpretation.
I know the score I'm looking at now is the Henle version from 2015 onwards, so it's a reliable slur and strong/weak sign, but I think you should be able to hold it down a bit more. I think you can take it as an sf against the adjacent p rather than the general interpretation of sf.

You play the trills in bars 1 and 2 down like mordents, but I play them up to take advantage of the mordent in bar 5.
As I said before, I can't tell you what is the right way to play the song, and I was wondering if perhaps you are used to playing it in other interpreted versions.
Why does the eighth-note re in bar 5 and the first beat of bar 6 suddenly jump? Is it the Busoni version? Is it?
Did the rattling of the 14th bar show your dislike of it? Is it lack of practice?
From bar 15, it would be nice if the right hand and left hand each had some color/expression, like singing or dialoguing.
The eighth note in measure 20, the eighth note do, is the only highest eighth note, so please handle it carefully.
I was really stuck on the eighth note because it was almost the way I liked to play it, except for this note.

Originally, in the period when Bach composed his works, they were played on the harpsichord, not the piano. The harpsichord cannot hold its sound for a long time because of the instrument's structure. Therefore, when you listen to recordings, it sounds as if all the notes are cut off. Whether it is necessary to reproduce such a technique on the piano may be controversial, but I think it is good to imagine how it sounds in order to understand the composer's intention.

If you look at the first measure, you will see that an eighth rest is written deliberately in the left hand. I think this means that it should definitely be cut shorter than a quarter note. It makes it a little lighter.
And the right hand is the fugue motif (theme). There are various interpretations of the ornamental notes, and opinions differ as to whether they should be placed on the top or the bottom (in the first measure, whether they should be la solo or solo solo solo), but one important thing to remember is that in Baroque works, the rule is to always place them at the beginning of the beat. This means that the left hand's playing of the mi note and the beginning of the ornament must be at the same time. Be careful not to start before the left hand. An exception to this rule is the ornamentation that begins after the left hand, which can be found in works by French composers of the Baroque period.
And as mentioned above, this is a fugue, so the same theme appears many times. Once you mark them in the score, it will be easier to understand. The principle is that the same theme is basically played in the same way.
The eighth and ninth bars are called ""sequents,"" which are repetitive progressions. In bar 10, the zequenz is a more detailed movement. Here the repetition is one beat at a time. There is more forward force, leading to the cadenza (terminal form) in the next bar. The end form (dominant-tonica) flows all the way to the last note (here, the first note of measure 12, the ""Re"" note).
The theme then appears in the left hand, modulating to the major key. It is a good idea to start playing with a new mood here, so you may want to leave a little more space between notes. For this reason, it is better not to slow down too much at the end of the previous phrase to make it easier to express.
There is a ritardando on the last bar, but as was the trend in the Baroque era, I think it would be fine to play it without a rit and just add a momentary break before the last note.",test

Well, let me tell you a few things.
First of all, what does ""make it better"" mean? Let's clarify that.

This piece was written by the famous composer ""Mozart. He is a well-known composer whom everyone knows.
Mozart's works are often easy to understand the melody and easy to listen to with beautiful harmony.
This piece is also simple, but the harmony is stable.

First of all, a piece of music has the composer's ""feelings. He wants us to play it this way. I want you to play it like this.
I want the audience to be moved by the ""feelings"" that the composer has put into the piece.
First of all, there is the composer's ""thought. It is written in the score.

The ""andante"" at the beginning of the piece means ""a walking speed - around 72 bpm,
It is a little bit slower tempo.

The rest of the tempo is indicated by the strength of the ""p"" and ""sf"".
The ""p"" means ""less,"" while the ""sf"" means ""make that note especially strong and immediately weaker thereafter.

Therefore, your performance does not handle ""sf"" properly.
If you change it, your performance will touch the audience's heartstrings even more.

For example, you retarded the end of the piece at a casual level,
The subtle processing is done well,
Leave it as it is.
Enjoy the rest of the performance.",train

I could tell that you played carefully.
Do you want to make it better?
(Learner)
Yes, but I don't know what to do.
(Instructor)
Well, let me explain a little.
First of all, what does ""make it better"" mean? Let's clarify that.

This piece was written by the famous composer ""Chopin. He was active as both a pianist and a composer.
He was active as both a pianist and a composer, and he was very much attached to the piano,
He wrote many solo piano pieces. This piece is no exception.

First of all, the music has the composer's ""feelings"". I want you to play it like this. The ""feelings"" that the composer put into the piece will move the audience.
I want the audience to be moved by the ""feelings"" that the composer put into the piece.
First of all, there is the composer's ""thought. It is written in the score.

For example, ""dolce"" at the beginning means ""please play softly.
And ""Andantino"" is a word about the speed of the piece, meaning a little faster than ""Andante"".
Andante"" means ""as fast as you can walk,"" and ""Andante"" means ""as fast as you can walk,
It may be more appropriate if you have a light image of the song.

If you take the current performance with this in mind, I think the speed of the music is exactly as it is in the score.

Now, the other aspect of ""make it better"" is,
What is the message of this piece of music?
A piece of music is a story. A story has a purpose.
To convey that purpose,

<Start> <Circumstance> <Event> <Completion> <Event> <Settlement> <Decision

The story progresses in this order.
In this piece, the last four bars are the melody of <Conclusion>.

In order to effectively impress the audience with this melody, it is up to the performers how they grasp the tune and play it.
It is up to the performer to do so.

The score says ""dolce"" ~ please play softly~ at the beginning of the piece.
The composer's intention is to start the story quietly,
It is true that if you play it vigorously from the beginning, there will not be enough gap to the final climax, and it will be difficult to give an impression of the end,
It would be difficult to impress the audience at the end, wouldn't it?

How to effectively create this ""drop off"" is what is required of the performer,
This is what is required of performers.

If you review your performance from this point of view, you may find that the ""drop"" is small,
The ""drop"" may be too small.
I think it would be more effective if you play the weaker parts sweetly and softly.

For example, the half-note in bar 8 could be played more softly.
For example, the half note in the eighth bar could be played more softly, because the story is over in the eighth bar.
After this, the next story begins again. So, in order to make the flow of the story clearer
I'll hold back the half-note part here.

And one more thing,
In addition to strength and weakness, you can also adjust the speed
In addition to strength and weakness, you can also adjust the speed in your performance.

Try to make the quarter note before the 13th bar a little longer than a normal quarter note.
Then you can emphasize the second note of the 13th bar, which is the culmination of the story of this piece,
You can emphasize it.

But when you play the piece, you should be more conscious of the story I have just told you.
But when you play, rather than being conscious of the story I just told you,
Rather, play the melody as if you are ""singing along"" with it in your body.

If you can do this naturally
your playing will naturally become better.

This piece is characterized by the contrast between long two-note notes and moving eighth-note phrases.
Conversely, it tends to sound monotonous because it consists of only those two.
To avoid monotony, for example, be careful that the length and volume of the long extended bifurcation notes do not always seem the same.
To figure out how to do this, it helps to look at the types of chords.
There are two concepts of chords: consonants (concertants) and dissonants (dissonants).
Consonants are simply chords with no muddy notes, while dissonants are chords with muddy notes. For example, the chord in bar 2 is a consonance, while the chord in bar 6 is a disonant because of the clash between so and la.
Since dissonance has a strong character, it means that the chord in measure 6 is more emphatic than the chord in measure 2.
Compare the chords in bars 6 and 14 for the same dissonance: bar 6 has 7 chords and bar 14 has 9 chords. Then the 14th bar has a more dissonant element.
In this way, you will be able to perceive differences even in a monotonous composition if you think about it more deeply. On top of that, depending on the length and strength of the chords, as well as which notes within the chords you wish to emphasize, differences will emerge, resulting in a diverse and varied performance.
To help those chords, please also think together about how to play the eighth-note passages that lead to the chords.

It is important to think of eighth-note passages as a single wave-like movement.
The way the slurs are applied will make it easier to see how far they are in a single mass.
In your performance, the passages in the main right hand and the left hand sounded like a single mass, but you should also pay attention to the passages in the inner voices, as in bars 7 and 11. Make sure to check carefully that the volume and length of the notes are not disjointed from note to note, so that they too sound as one mass.",train

The left hand phrases in bars 67 and 68 were sloppy, so sing them so that they float out but not unevenly.

Well, let me explain a little.
First of all, what does ""make it better"" mean? Let's clarify that.

This piece was written by the famous composer ""Bach. He was active as both an organist and a composer.
He was active as both an organist and a composer, and his improvisations are especially wonderful,
Some people say that none of Bach's works can compare to his improvisations.

First of all, a piece of music has the composer's ""feelings. He wants you to play it this way. I want you to play it like this.
I want the audience to be moved by the ""feelings"" that the composer put into the piece.
First of all, there is the composer's ""thought. It is written in the score.
It is not written in the score, but it is written in the words of the music,
The words ""moderato"" and ""moderato"" are used to describe the speed of the music.
Moderato"", ""Allegretto"", ""Allegretto"", and so on.
Your playing is closer to ""Allegretto"". I think it is a good choice.


Now, another aspect of ""make it better"" is,
What is the message of this piece?

What the composer Bach wanted to express in this piece is the beauty produced by ""two melodies.
Music in which multiple melodies are played to produce beauty is called ""polyphony,
The origin of polyphony is the beauty produced by two melodies.

I feel that the overall performance is beautiful.
The balance between the right hand and the left hand is even and well played,
However, it might be kind to make the structure clearer for the music that progresses in the same way.
It may be kind to the listener to make the structure clearer, since the music proceeds in the same way.
In that sense, I think it is one melody up to the beginning of the 12th bar,
It would be better if you give a little extra time to the eighth note of the right hand at the beginning of the twelfth bar.
It would be better if you consider it as one melody until the beginning of the 12th bar.

This kind of music with two contrasting melodies is called
counterpoint"" and is considered a basic compositional technique.
One of the points of ""counterpoint"" is not that the two melodies are compounded into one, but rather
The more prominent the exchange between the two melodies, the less monotonous and the more beautiful the music will sound.

In this sense, it is better to play the line where the left hand moves, such as bars 6, 11, 14, and 20, with your attention focused on the left hand, so that the balance of the two melodies will naturally stand out.
I think that by playing with the left hand's attention focused on the left hand, the balance will naturally become more pronounced.",train

Let's look at the left hand first. Looking at the note pattern, there is an eighth-note dispersed chord (bar 1) and an eighth-note section with an even number of notes playing the same note (bar 3, for example). The former has a slur every four notes; the latter does not. The former's dispersed chords are strongly ascending and have a powerful unity, while the latter is stagnant. If this difference in expression were made clearer, the left hand passages would be more dynamic.
The long slur from the 12th bar requires mobility to propel the phrase forward with the left hand without interruption; I think it would be better to bring it all the way to the forte in the 16th bar to express a longer phrase.
The repetition of the note pattern with the first eight rests in the 35th bar gives a sense of uncertainty and anticipation, as if you don't know what happens next. It then reaches its apex in the next measure and descends quickly from there. The rhythm of measure 36 is a triplet followed by four sixteenth notes, but it is better to play this rhythm as if it is plunging into the next measure, rather than playing it rhythmically. I think the music will be more three-dimensional if you play it with the image of a plodding into the next bar, rather than playing the rhythm as it is.
The 58th bar has a similar shape. This one is more dramatic, with a longer distance from the flat of the apex la to the natural of the ci below, and even a fermata with an sf (sforzando) on the note you reach. I think the sf in your playing is very good. I would like to see the descending form before it, if possible, with more downward suction.

This one is more dramatic, with a longer distance from the flat of the apex la to the natural of the ci below, and even a fermata with an sf (sforzando) on the note you reach. I think the sf in your playing is very good. I would like to see the descending form before it, if possible, with more downward suction.

404,n28-bet-snt008-3-s-p02_c03.txt,n28-bet-snt008-3-s-p02.wav,"I think it is nicely organized.
Let's look at the left hand first. Looking at the note pattern, there is an eighth-note dispersed chord (bar 1) and an eighth-note section with an even number of notes playing the same note (bar 3, for example). The former has a slur every four notes; the latter does not. The former's dispersed chords are strongly ascending and have a powerful unity, while the latter is stagnant. If this difference in expression were made clearer, the left hand passages would be more dynamic.
The long slur from the 12th bar requires mobility to propel the phrase forward with the left hand without interruption; I think it would be better to bring it all the way to the forte in the 16th bar to express a longer phrase.
The repetition of the note pattern with the first eight rests in the 35th bar gives a sense of uncertainty and anticipation, as if you don't know what happens next. It then reaches its apex in the next measure and descends quickly from there. The rhythm of measure 36 is a triplet followed by four sixteenth notes, but it is better to play this rhythm as if it is plunging into the next measure, rather than playing it rhythmically. I think the music will be more three-dimensional if you play it with the image of a plodding into the next bar, rather than playing the rhythm as it is.

(Instructor)
What do you think should be done to make it better?
(Learner)
I want to improve my expressive ability, but I'm not sure what exactly I should do.
(Instructor)
Well, let me tell you a few things.
First of all, what does ""improve"" mean? Let's clarify it.

This piece was written by the famous composer ""Debussy. At first, he wanted to be a pianist,
However, he could not achieve good results in competitions, so he gave up and devoted himself to composing music.
He had a passion for piano music and wrote string pieces and songs.
He has established a firm position in piano music.

First of all, a piece of music has the composer's ""feelings. He wanted the piece to be played this way. I want you to play it like this.
I want the audience to be moved by the ""feelings"" that the composer has put into the piece.
First of all, there is the composer's ""thought. It is written in the score.

Andantino sans lenteur"" is an indication of the tempo of the piece.
Andantino"" is a little faster than ""andante,"" and ""sans lenteur"" is added to it.
It should be about 80 bpm.

The other thing is the ""dim"" ~dim"" ~ ""gradually weaker"" in the 15th bar.
In general, I think it is appropriate to have the feeling of floating rather than playing energetically.
I think your playing sounds similar to that.
Rather than increasing the level of the ""mf"" to add dynamics, I think it would be better to play the weak beats more carefully and softly,
I think that playing the weak beats more carefully and softly will bring out the characteristics of the piece.

Now, what should we do to make this song better?
What should we do to make this song better?

Do you have any ideas?

(Learner)
Yes, I do. Should I play it with more emotion, as if I am speaking to you?

(Instructor)
That may be so,
This song is a song that gives the impression of an unaffected landscape.
If you put emotion as the standard, you may end up being verbose, i.e., exaggerating.

The way I see it, there are three factors to consider when performing

1. control of tempo
2. control of intensity
3. length of notes

These three allow for emotional regulation.

In classical music, the conductor of an orchestral piece will give instructions regarding these three factors.
In some cases, the ""tempo"" can be adjusted drastically, but too much of this can lead to talkativeness.
Just as it is easier for others to understand you if you speak at a steady pace when you are conversing, so it is not a good idea to make large adjustments in speed.
It is not a good idea to adjust the speed too much.

Even if ""1. tempo"" is constant, ""2. control of intensity"" can make a big difference in the expression of the melody,
The expression of the melody can be greatly changed and is effective.

This piece has many arpeggio phrases,
It would be better if you can feel the beat of these phrases in two-beat units.
It will not become monotonous.
In order to achieve this, please play the phrases with a sense of
and play it with a feeling of raising the beat.

The change is already there, but I think we can add more change by taking a breath to go to the next phrase. Breaths are not taken just to breathe, but to breathe in preparation for the next phrase.　Imagine yourself as a conductor.

First of all, what does ""make it better"" mean? Let's clarify that.

This piece was written by the famous composer ""Chopin. He was active as both a pianist and a composer.

First of all, there is the composer's ""thought. It is written in the score.

However, there are only two ""p ""s in this piece: ""pianissimo"" and ""rit""-dan-dan-dan late.
It is difficult to play it the way you just played it from the score.
But since this song is famous, everyone knows that it is played this fast, so you can do it.
You can do it because it is well known.
But if you play it many times and check the whole picture and make a decision, it may take the shape you are playing now.

Now to make this song better.
What should I do?

Do you have any ideas?

(Learner)
Yes, I do. Should I play it with more emotion, as if I am speaking to you?


(Instructor)
That may be so,
If you put emotion as the criterion, you can become talkative, i.e., you can exaggerate.

The idea is that there are three elements when performing

1. control of tempo
2. control of intensity
3. length of notes

Emotional control is achieved through these three factors.
In the case of classical music, the conductor of an orchestral piece will give instructions regarding these three factors.
In some cases, the ""tempo"" is adjusted drastically, but too much of this can lead to talkativeness.
Just as it is easier for others to understand you if you speak at a steady pace when you are conversing, so it is not a good idea to make large speed adjustments.
It is not a good idea to adjust the speed too much.

Even if ""1. tempo"" is constant, ""2. control of intensity"" can make a big difference in the expression of the melody,
The expression of the melody can be greatly changed and is effective.
