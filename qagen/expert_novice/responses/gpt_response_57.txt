7. Teacher: This was too fast, and the notes were off (for example in the last two-ish measures two Cs were played instead of a D in then a C). Also the fast tempo didn't carry enough to the chorus so it seemed like the beginning was rushed and the end couldn't keep us. I liked the dynamic variation though, it had nice phrasing comparatively so it was fun to listen to.
