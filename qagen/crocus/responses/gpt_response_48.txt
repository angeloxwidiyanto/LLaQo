0.  Teacher: I think it is played in a light and graceful manner typical of Mozart. What bothered me, however, was the treatment of the midora and the descending la in the right hand in the 12th bar. I felt that only the notes of the midora and the descending la in the right hand stood out strangely and did not match the music. Also, the end of the piece sounds too much like the end of the piece. I thought it would be better if it sounded as if it continued on to the next section. However, I was impressed by the way the sforzando was inserted naturally and beautifully. Overall, the performance is an example of what an andante grazioso should sound like. I would like to listen to the rest of the performance.

1. Teacher: (Applause.) It's wonderful. I also want you to do this one more. At the first theme, I hear too much of the inner voice, so ignore it more. I want more bass. Play it with the bass in mind. I can't say enough about the episodes from 17 and the reproduction from 29! It's perfect in terms of color and hoarding! Let's do the 3rd movement already soon.

      1. Q: In which skill level would you say the performer is in? A: The performer is highly skilled.
      2. Q: Is there reasonable balance between hands? A: There needs to be more bass emphasis.
      3. Q: How would you rate the difficulty level of this piece? A: The piece is challenging, with the performer doing exceptionally well on parts 17 and 29 and is ready to move on to the 3rd movement.

2. Teacher: The notes written in the score itself were picked up. However, the overall impression was one of roughness and lack of intonation. For example, the first note is indicated as P, but it is played at a volume of about F. The first note was played at a volume of about F from beginning to end, when it should have been played with intonation in accordance with the change of harmony and the progress of the music. In terms of expression, again, the reading of the score is insufficient. For example, in the 6th bar, Schumann wrote a crescendo for the right hand A note on the second beat, but this is not expressed. The left hand needs to be restrained a little, and the volume of the left and right hands should be balanced to emphasize the A note. In the fourth measure, from the second to the fourth beat of the left hand, the pedal should not muddy each note. Further study is needed to express the lovely and fantastic atmosphere of this piece.

     2. Q: Is the pedal change clean? A: No, the pedal was not used properly in the fourth measure leading to muddied notes.
     3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: The student needs to work on reading the score, the balance between left and right hand,and the use of the pedal.

3. Teacher: I was able to clearly understand how they wanted to play the piece and how they wanted to play it. It was a wonderful performance, and it seemed as if the player had a good understanding of the piece. The understanding of Romantic music was well-developed, and the way she played was delicate. Especially, I could feel her understanding of harmony and the tension of changing harmonies. Even in the parts where the inner voices moved, I could feel the harmony in each note. I think the balance of bass, inner voice, and melody is just right. There were many variations of expression in the "p" and it was pleasant to listen to. I thought it would be nice if there were more expressions that gave a sense of tension in the "p".
