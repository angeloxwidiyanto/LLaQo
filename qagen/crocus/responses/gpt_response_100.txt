1. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: I was concerned about the short and staccato performance of note values.

A: The student needs to work on staying faithful to the score in classical pieces such as Beethoven's, and consider the performance structure of the piece while creating a musical mountain. They should connect the notes toward the 4th bar and think about how these clusters of notes can form a big flow in succession.
