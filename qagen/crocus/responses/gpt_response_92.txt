2. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: The third bar's "Shido sisora sirafa" and the fifth bar's "rasidore" are uneven and the 16th bar's remifami is broken.
3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: Improve technique by practicing basic exercises so that the sixteenth note doesn't fall down and play the part where you fall down firmly and properly in fortissimo.

Feedback 1:
1. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: The performance was very carefully played, with a clear awareness of even the melodic delimitations of the bass.

3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: To show a more energetic and strong-willed performance.

Feedback 2:
1. Q: Is the interpretation appropriate to the style of the composition? A: The impression of the Trommelai changes drastically depending on how you add fluctuations.
2. Q: Is there reasonalbe dynamics contrast? A: Although the score only describes crescendos, strengthening a note means that there is a "weak part," and repeated crescendos mean that there is a cycle of weakening and strengthening.
3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: Study more how to give different expressions to similar phrases, and ensure that pre-strike notes and arpeggios are played gracefully.

Feedback 3:
1. Q: Is the pedal change clean? A: Change the pedal on the third beat of the fourth bar.
2. Q: Is the performed tempo stable? A: The tempo is also fine.
3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: In the arpeggio of the 12th bar, play each note firmly and carefully. The left hand chords in bars 24-27 need to be clean. The quarter rests in the second and third beats of measure 37 need to be emphasized by counting the three beats in your mind.
