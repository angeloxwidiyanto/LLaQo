1. Q: Is the performance hesitant or smooth? A: The tempo sounded like it was moving forward in a bumpy, stuttering way, beyond the fluctuating range. 
2. Q: Is the phrasing or melodic shaping clear? A: I could feel the breath going into the ninth bar, but it was sucked in too slowly. The right hand accent in bar 13 was missing. The ff in bar 17 lacked volume and the decrescendo wasn't enough, and only the melody was suddenly stoned down to p in bar 18.
3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: The student needs to sing the melody as it is written, including all slurs, accents, etc. The student also needs to attend to the volume, legato, and score instructions for dynamics and tempo.

Feedback 1:
1. Q: Is there reasonable balance between hands? A: There is not much volume variation in the left hand arpeggio. The pp at the beginning should be smaller and sound like it is far away. 
2. Q: Is the pedal change clean? A: The sound sometimes breaks off when the pedal is released.
3. Q: How would you rate the difficulty level of this piece? A: The student needs to adjust the strength and weakness of the playing and the length of the note with the finger.

Feedback 2:
1. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: In the left hand of measure 2, there was a missing note when repeated. 
2. Q: Is the pedal usage appropriate? A: The pedaling is a problem with the pedal being left depressed on the fourth and sixth beats of the fourth measure and being a bit deep.
3. Q: Is the interpretation appropriate to the style of the composition? A: The first beat of the 10th bar should be played at the same time, not before the A note strike of the left hand, considering the style of the time.

Feedback 3:
1. Q: How is the overall tempo? A: The tempo is precise and balanced throughout.
2. Q: Is the rhythm accurate? A: The triplet in bar 8 is also very lively and carefully connected to the next "Do".
3. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: Many of Beethoven's sonatas in the second movement, such as Adagio and Andante, are relatively slow. The student plays them calmly, singing the melody with a sense of composure.
