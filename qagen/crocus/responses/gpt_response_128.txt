1. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: There are several inaccuracies; in the fourth measure, the eighth note seems to enter a beat early, and in the second bar from the end, the note position is early. Also, the note of the left hand in measure 10 is wrong.
2. Q: Is the pedal usage appropriate? A: In the sixteenth measure once the chord is established on the second beat, the pedal usage can be improved to avoid it becoming muddy.
3. Q: Is there reasonable balance between hands? A: This piece has many voices, but they sound beautifully balanced. It is a good performance.

1. Q: How is the overall tempo? A: The tempo is a little slow compared to Allegro.
2. Q: Is the articulation appropriate? A: The staccato in both hands in measure 17 is too long and the second note in measure 46 is also long, for appropriate articulation, these need to be shortened.
3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: Several aspects need work on, including increasing the tempo, fixing inaccurate notes, improving staccato articulation among others.

1. Q: Is the phrasing or melodic shaping clear? A: At the break of a phrase and the beginning of the next phrase, you might want to practice a little "breathing" and wait for the notes.
2. Q: Is the interpretation appropriate to the style of the composition? A: It suggests trying to play the song while singing it to work on the cantabile expression which seems a little inadequate presently.
3. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: The performer should experiment with singing the song or playing it while singing, to notice if it helps in breath control or changes in the dancer's technique.

1. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: It's great to have a personal expression and perspective, but the rubato seems to be rushed.
2. Q: Is the interpretation appropriate to the style of the composition? A: No. The slurs are broken in the ascending phrases of the first and second bars suggesting a need for improvement in interpretation.
3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: It might be beneficial to lessen the rubato and keep the balance in mind.
