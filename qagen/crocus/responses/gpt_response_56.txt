0. Teacher: Overall, nicely put together. The pedal was switched frequently so that the sound did not become muddy; only the seventh bar was a little muddy. The atmosphere changed from the ninth bar, where there were a few more notes, and it sounded a bit muddy.

1. Teacher: The melody was played smoothly and legato as if it were sung, and I could feel that she was conscious of this. It was a wonderful performance that reached my heart. The rhythm of the "ornamented" part sometimes wavered a little, I think it is better to play it with the image of how it was originally played on the harpsichord.

2. Teacher: There are some parts where the tone is hard, such as the A note in the right hand in measure 6. Also, some notes sound unnaturally accented in the inner voices of the right hand in bars 11 and 15. Try to make the melody line sound good. The beginning of the piece was good with a soft image, so try to play with this tone throughout the piece.

3. Teacher: The overall impression is one of indifference. The first p. might be better if it is softly introduced rather than softly and weakly. A little more cantabile (singing intonation) would be good. I would like you to play it with care so as not to make it too easy!
