0. Teacher: The performance captures the structure of the piece, and the eighth notes in the left hand and other notes are carefully practiced. Overall, I have the impression that your fingertips have a touch as if you are hitting the keyboard, and I am particularly concerned about the broken notes in the octave. In octaves and harmonies, listen carefully to the balance between the upper and lower notes. I think the change of scene could be conveyed if you could express more the singing of a new phrase by breathing in the quarter rest in the 43rd bar. This is a voluminous piece, but I think you have practiced it well. Please try to play it in the same length as the original.
