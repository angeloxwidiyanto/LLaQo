Here are the standardised QA pairs for the teachers' feedbacks.

Feedback 0:
1. Q: Is the performance following score instructions? A: Needs more emphasis on the motifs especially the entrance part. Also, be more precise with the trills and make sure to synchronize with the left hand note.
2. Q: Is the phrasing or melodic shaping clear? A: Yes, but there needs to be more variation, for instance a more emphasized crescendo articulation and change in tune from the 6th bar onward.
3. Q: What does the student need to work on? A: The student needs to work on the clarity of motifs in right and left hand, executing the trills appropriately, and adding more variation in the tune especially in terms of crescendo articulation and phrasing.

Feedback 1:
1. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: The tone is soft and easy to listen to, and the chrescendo is lively. 
2. Q: What does the student need to work on? A: The student needs to add more variation in tune especially from the 6th bar and needs to accentuate the stretto in the seventh bar.
3. Q: Is the interpretation appropriate to the style of the composition? A: Yes, the detailed phrasing of the melody is well captured.

Feedback 2:
1. Q: Is there reasonable balance between hands? A: The balance could be better by making bass sound little more resonant.
2. Q: How would you rate the difficulty level of this piece? A: The piece has the same chords and harmony, but changes in the 12th measure and requires awareness of harmony.
3. Q: What does the student need to work on? A: The student should be more conscious of phrase ends, and try to adjust balance feeling the harmony.

Feedback 3:
1. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: It is clear there is an understanding of the development of imitation and repetition of theme through counterpoint, but it's still far from ideal.
2. Q: What does the student need to work on? A: The student needs to practice trills, work on making the scale smooth, be more mindful of the length of each note, practice the separation, and revise the timing of the ritardando.
3. Q: Is the interpretation appropriate to the style of the composition? A: No, the interpretation still needs work especially with regard to playing trills, managing scale ascensions, and executing ritardando.
