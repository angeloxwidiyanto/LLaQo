1. Teacher: Pedal timing is slow and the first beat tends to be muddy. The overall sound is muddy, so it is better to use the pedal more frequently and thinly. In bar 8, the left hand is strong on the second beat. The ff is weak, and the p at the beginning is strong. It was good that the atmosphere changed in the 19th bar. The final fit is also good. The tempo of the modifier note matched the tempo of the preceding part.

2. Teacher: Each phrase is short, so use inflection to give the song a richer impression. Don't always keep the same amount of bisyllabic notes, but slow and strong in addition to rit. Chords in both the left and right hands are very beautiful with a uniform grain. The beginning of the piece should be sweet and lovely sounding with "dolce" in mind. Try to imagine compact music, as if you are playing for a few people in a salon rather than in a concert hall.
