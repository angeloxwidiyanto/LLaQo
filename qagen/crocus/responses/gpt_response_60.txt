1. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: The performance aimed to bring out the lightness and clarity in Mozart's sonata. However, this was not fully achieved due to the pedaling and heavy staccato notes.
2. Q: Is the pedal change clean? A: The use of the pedal muddied the sound in the first bar, affecting the distinction between the melody and the lower voices. A cleaner pedal change is recommended.
3. Q: Is the articulation appropriate? A: The frontal and staccato notes were heavy and took away from the intended light tone. A more relaxed finger technique could improve the articulation.

1. Q: In which skill level would you say the performer is in? A: The performer is playing well overall. With more focus on touch and control, they could bring out the delicacy that the piece demands.
2. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: The student should practice to deepen their interpretation of "Dream" and effectively portray the ambiguity and unstable elements of the piece. 
3. Q: Is the interpretation appropriate to the style of the composition? A: The interpretation could involve a better use of ambiguity and unstable elements inherent in the composition.

1. Q: How would you rate the difficulty level of this piece? A: The performance made this piece seem relatively easy. However, there is room for adding color to the piece. 
2. Q: Is the performance following score instructions? A: Instructions provided in the score are not fully followed, particularly around dynamics and articulation. Specific issues were found in bars 2, 22, 23, 27, 30, and 33-to-end.
3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: The student needs to pay closer attention to the score instructions, particularly around dynamics, articulations and expressions. Specific improvements can be made in bars 2, 22, 23, 27, 30, and towards the end.

For teacher feedback 3:

1. Q: Is there reasonable balance between hands? A: The left hand has a larger presence in the performance which disrupts the balance. 
2. Q: Is the articulation appropriate? A: Articulations, particularly in the 16th to 17th bars and in the left hand, did not fully follow the score instructions. Fine control in the length of eighth notes is recommended. 
3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: The student should focus on achieving a better balance between the hands, following the score's articulation instructions, and improving control over note lengths in the left hand.
