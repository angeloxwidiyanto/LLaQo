Here are the generated QA pairs for the teacher feedbacks:

0. Teacher Feedback: I thought it was a beautiful performance. The tempo, the inner voices, the way the rubato is handled and the pauses, etc. are all exemplary in the creation of the piece. The only thing that bothered me a little was that the accented notes sometimes sounded broken. This may possibly be the fault of the computer. But apart from this, it is an excellent performance.
1. Q: How is the overall tempo? A: The tempo is handled well.
2. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: It was a beautiful performance.
3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: The accented notes sometimes sounded broken.

1. Teacher Feedback: I think you sing very carefully and have a wonderful air about you. I think it is very good that you have your own world. However, I think it would be even better if you could insist on the notes that should be emphasized, because there are often notes that are considered important that are left out. The tempo is a little unnatural. Chord on the first beat of the 17th bar should be fortissimo with more presence.

2. Teacher Feedback: The performance was strong and powerful, typical of Beethoven. I was concerned about the loss of notes in the left hand in the 6th and 11th bars. The right hand in bar 30 is played in staccato even though it is legato.

3. Teacher Feedback: Try to play the opening notes with both hands at the same time so that they do not shift. Let the melody be heard with a little less inner voice. The accent is on the "Do #" in the third beat of the third measure and the "Fa #" in the third beat of the fourth measure.
1. Q: Is the performance hesitant or smooth? A: Not smooth, the opening notes shift between two hands.
2. Q: Is the balance between right and left hand appropriate? A: Needs more balance, both hands should play the opening note at the same time.
3. Q: Is there a clear phrasing or melodic shaping? A: The melody needs to be heard with a little less inner voice.
