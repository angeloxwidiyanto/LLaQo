Here are the QA pairs for the teacher feedbacks:

Teacher Feedback 0:
1. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: Pay attention to fingering to ensure there is no hesitation or "tame" when playing a note.
2. Q: Is there reasonable balance between hands? A: The counter-melody in the left hand should have more presence of sound, this piece should be balanced so that the right hand part and the left hand part are on equal footing and respond to each other.
3. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: At the end, fine-tune the sound toward the afterglow of the fermata without rit. Listen to the sound of clavichord and other ancient instruments, and play the piano with a touch that reproduces the lightness of the instruments of the time as much as possible.

Teacher Feedback 1:
1. Q: Is there reasonalbe dynamics contrast? A: The relative differences in dynamics could be more clear. 
2. Q: Is the pedal usage appropriate? A: The pedal should be a little more finely pressed, sometimes in shallow 16-note increments. The harmony was muddy in some parts which needs to be taken care of at this tempo.
3. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: The first note B natural might be too tame. It may be a matter of taste, but it could be played a little more smoothly.

Teacher Feedback 2:
1. Q: In which skill level would you say the performer is in?  A: Overall, I like the cohesiveness and strength of the piece.
2. Q: Is the performed tempo stable? A: Unintended tempo running at the triplets results in the left and right hands sounding disjointed. It would be better if it could be controlled a little more.
3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: Controlling the tempo during the triplets to avoid sounding disjointed.

Teacher Feedback 3: 
1. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: Be aware of the polish dance music in the three-beat pieces.
2. Q: Is there reasonalbe tempo contrast? A: The Andantino in the notation means slightly faster than Andante. If the phrases are played with a little more slur in one piece, the flow will be a little cleaner than it is now. 
3. Q: What does the student needs to work on? A: Being aware of a conversation or story for each phrase, emphasizing or retracting certain phrases and chords, playing a little longer or shorter, and so on will add more variation in the performance.
