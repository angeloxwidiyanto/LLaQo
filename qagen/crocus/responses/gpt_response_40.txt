Feedback 1:

1. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: It's difficult to play Bach's Inventions with a lot of leeway. Even the slightest mistake can be greatly felt by the audience. 
2. Q: What does the student need to work on? A: The way the ornaments are played is different when they appear in the right hand and when they appear in the left hand. This needs to be unified. 
3. Q: Is the interpretation appropriate to the style of the composition? A: The interpretation needs to better align with Bach's style.

Feedback 3:

1. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: There were a few inaccuracies, the Fis in the right hand in bars 1 and 9 is buried in the chords and needs to be clearer. Also, the ornamental Ais in bars 7 and 8 is too prominent. 
2. Q: Is the performance following score instructions? A: Some chords sound out of tune and the crescendo in bar 15 sounds like a sudden "f" after the second beat. 
3. Q: What does the student need to work on? A: The ticking sound throughout the piece is distracting, it suggests that the fingernails might be too long. Also, the left hand from the second beat of measure 13 sounds muddy. The pedaling could be improved.
