3. Teacher: On spot with the sheets. In my opinion, only a few piano players in the history could play something 99.9% perfect (because nothing is perfect). Here, I set the maximum perfection to 98% since these are students. This person played 95% perfect on that scale, only thing I did not like was the ending of the first chorus before repetition, it was a bit wobbly and not convincing enough. However, an amazing job, a solid 5, especially relative to other performances. March vibe was carried out wonderfully!
