Here are the QA pairs generated from Teacher feedback:

Feedback 0: Very accurate 
Generate: 
   1. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: Very accurate. 
   2. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: Very accurate.

Feedback 1: The notes and rhythms were all correct. They maintained a steady tempo and it all felt very consistent. However, they didn't pay attention to crescendo or ritardando notation or dynamics. Overall, they played the notes and rhythms correctly but not the additional notation.
Generate:
   1. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: The notes were all correct.
   2. Q: Is the rhythm accurate? A: The rhythms were all correct.
   3. Q: Is the performed tempo stable? A: They maintained a steady tempo and it all felt very consistent.
   4. Q: Is there reasonalbe dynamics contrast? A: They didn't pay attention to crescendo or ritardando notation or dynamics.

Feedback 2: Well done! Accurate reading on all accounts.
Generate:
   1. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: Well done!
   2. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: Accurate reading on all accounts.
  
Feedback 3: The piece was played well and accurately. The ritardando at the end was a little subtle, but overall was pleasant to listen to.
Generate:
   1. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: The piece was played well and pleasantly to listen to.
   2. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: The piece was played accurately.
   3. Q: Is there reasonalbe tempo contrast? A: The ritardando at the end was a little subtle.

Feedback 4: Very good performance!!  Could do more dynamics, and rit at end
Generate:
   1. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: Very good performance!
   2. Q: Is there reasonalbe dynamics contrast? A: Could do more dynamics.
   3. Q: Is there reasonalbe tempo contrast? A: rit at end.

Feedback 5: Good in every aspect but dynamics and rhythm markings.
Generate:
   1. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: Good in every aspect.
   2. Q: Is the rhythm accurate? A: Not marked well.
   3. Q: Is there reasonalbe dynamics contrast? A: Dynamics not marked well.

Feedback 6: Good tempo, good balance. Dynamics not observed. No Rit at end.
Generate:
   1. Q: How is the overall tempo? A: Good tempo.
   2. Q: Is there reasonable balance between hands? A: Good balance.
   3. Q: Is there reasonalbe dynamics contrast? A: Not observed.
   4. Q: Is there reasonalbe tempo contrast? A: No Rit at end.

Feedback 7: The notes and tempo are correct, but the dynamics and retard aren't obvious enough.
Generate:
   1. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: The notes are correct.
   2. Q: Is the performed tempo stable? A: The tempo is correct.
   3. Q: Is there reasonalbe dynamics contrast? A: Dynamics aren't obvious enough.
   4. Q: Is there reasonalbe tempo contrast? A: Retard isn't obvious enough.
