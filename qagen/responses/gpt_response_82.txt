0. Teacher: Too fast. Dead stops in several places. Pitches, however, are correct.
     Generate:
     1. Q: Is the performed tempo stable? A: No, too fast.

     1. Q: In which skill level would you say the performer is in? A: A good player.
     2. Q: Is the performance hesitant or smooth? A: Hesitant, forgot where hands should go halfway through.
     3. Q: What does the student need to work on? A: Consistency in performance, especially towards the second half.

2. Teacher: All notes and rhythm are played correctly. But tempo is a bit too fast for the student, hence the starting and stopping. Slow the tempo down, and you can play more accurately.
     Generate:
     1. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: Yes, all notes are played correctly.
     2. Q: Is the rhythm accurate? A: Yes, rhythm is played correctly.
     3. Q: Is the performed tempo stable? A: No, tempo is too fast causing starting and stopping.
     4. Q: What does the student need to work on? A: Slowing the tempo down for more accuracy.

3. Teacher: It has a great start, but sounds not continuous when moving into the second half.
     Generate:
     1. Q: How would you describe the emotional intent of the performance? A: Great start.
     2. Q: Is the performance hesitant or smooth? A: Hesitant, not continuous when moving into the second half.

4. Teacher: Dynamics not observed.  Slight hesitation page 2.  Tempo a little rushed. 
     Generate:
     1. Q: Is there reasonable dynamics contrast? A: No, dynamics not observed.
     2. Q: Is the performance hesitant or smooth? A: Slight hesitation in page 2.
     3. Q: How is the overall tempo? A: Tempo is a little rushed.

     1. Q: Is there reasonable dynamics contrast? A: No, F/P dynamics not observed.
     2. Q: Is the performed tempo stable? A: No, slightly fast.
     3. Q: Is the performance hesitant or smooth? A: Hesitant, big hesitations in lines 2 and 4.

7. Teacher: The left hand A and F thirds weren't played as written with the rest between them. Right before the D7 notes, the first measure of the second page, you could hear hesitation before playing longer strings of notes. It was too fast and as a result a lot of uncertainty in both the notes and rhythm.
     Generate:
     1. Q: Is the performed note accurate? A: No, left hand A and F thirds weren't played as written.
     2. Q: Is the performance hesitant or smooth? A: Hesitant, especially before the D7 notes.
